# Lecture
A circuit is a collection of logical gates that transforms a set of binary inputs into a set of binary outputs.

## Building Circuits
1. Truth tables
2. Using And and Not to form expressions for all '1' outputs
3. Add all expressions
4. Transform to Circuit

## Optimization

| 01  | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 11  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 10  | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |

- Find parterns that some inputs don't matter
- Overlap is fine.
- Order matters (11), but Farid forgot to explain why.

# Q&A
## How do you get better at using abstraction?
- Accurately describe the things you have to work with.
- Knowing the things you can do.
- Noticing function features (range, domain, and intent).
- Rewrite for getting rid of things except for essence.
